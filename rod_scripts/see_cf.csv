With all due respect, I call BS. 

Here it is almost 2am on a work night, and there's a party going on in front of my house! With cops! In cars! Flying up and down the road. Screeching tires! Flashing lights! Whooping and hollering (ok, maybe not so much whooping and hollering but my point is)

ITS. TWO. AM. ON. A. WORK. NIGHT. PEOPLE!!! I cant sleep. I mean, I *could* sleep but.... I go to sleep and the Indy 500 starts in my front yard. As I pointed out to the very nice female officer whom I approached whilst seated beside Six Forks Rd, ITS TWO AM ON A WORK NIGHT, can't you move your operation 100 yards up the road to the corner of Cranbrook? There's a wider spot in the road! You can get people on radar quicker! You can see further up the road! There are no houses near there were you are going to ADVERSELY AFFECT SOMEONES SLEEP!! Her curt and polite answer was ""Oh, well we like this spot, it's our favorite, we've always used it"" Really? I mean, hold on. REALLY?
You wanna catch speeders you say, Capt RL Munn? Well then why don't you get your race team out here each and every morning from 7am to, oh, 9am and run a Florida Speed Trap with an officer on the side of the road running radar and 10 cars behind him, primed and ready to pounce. Lets never mind the fact that it'll snarl traffic so severely someone might actually complain, but you say basically I will be woken (or is that awoke?) each and every night your officers so dictate that they park in their ""favorite spot"" because you know, its for the 'greater good'. If the 'greater good' is getting speeders to slow down as the are approaching Carroll Middle School (as a member of the Capital Police pointed out to me) then shouldn't your teams be out en force at an later hour instead of 2am?

87,1318723,Signals / Signs,"PLEASE re-open my earlier concern about the bus stop in front of the east facade of 401 Oberlin Road.  This morning, coach 1284, Outbound 12 Method, leaving Moore Square Station *DID* board passengers at the shelter located as described above.  *HOWEVER*, I could not see that there was any sign indicating that this was a CAT bus stop.  AND, MOREOVER, the safety concern I alluded to in my earlier inquiry has not been alleviated.  Specifically, the stop located about 8-9 meters North of the intersection of Oberlin and Stafford has not been moved to the site east of 401 Oberlin with passenger amenities.  The stop at 401 Oberlin Road appears to be without sign, which will discourage new riders from choosing this as an initial point of engagement with the CAT system and -- arguably -- causes confusion to existing riders as to whether passenger amenities are available to all patrons or -- at certain locales -- only to an exclusive group of invitees.  

The exiting stop, 8-9 meters north of the intersection of Oberlin and Stafford is a pedestrian death waiting to happen.

I sincerely invite you to ask the driver of coach 1284, Outbound 12 Method about the measures she TRIED to take to warn a passenger who had just disembarked that a vehicle was turning west onto Stafford from the Southbound center lane of Oberlin in front of the coach and wholly without regard to pedestrian traffic crossing Stafford.

This is NOT an irregular occurrence and – in fact – will become less infrequent as the 401 building becomes more completely occupied.

I appreciate that the current stop on Oberlin is convenient for workers and patrons (including many seniors) wishing to visit the McDonald's on Oberlin Road and Cameron, but – on balance – I think the physical welfare and even lives of the few folks who disembark and trod south on the Oberlin sidewalk trumps the imposition of a few extra steps to reach the workplace or free coffee.",Open,"2204 Stafford Avenue Raleigh, North Carolina",2,35.7904917619862,-78.663097755129,https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1318723,337613,2014-10-12T21:20:38-04:00,2014-10-12T21:22:20-04:00,,

Cars were parked along the street on their side of the street and no one would take turns or even yield to on coming traffic and oull over or stop. Drivers going away from St Mary's St down Brooklyn St were stuck or had to find away to turn around. Drivers were going as far as driving up on the curb into people's yards to not let other cars pass.

There are no crosswalks at these intersections. A few years ago, a high school student was hit by a car while trying to cross this intersection.

The untouched section was still a breeding ground for voles, mice, snakes and mosquitoes.  The yards around this property are unusable due to the poison ivy growing through, the mosquitoes and the rodents running.  Children are unable to play in the neighboring yards because of the risk of poison and the possiblity of snakes, rodents etc.  Pets are unable to be left in neighboring yards due to the risk of hearworm carrying mosquitoes.

We need a permanent and immediate solution to the hedge located on a property on Wake Forest road (about 1/2 block up, on the left as you face north) near the intersection of Poplar Street.. This hedge COMPLETELY blocks visibility for cars on Poplar that are trying to turn onto Wake Forest Road in either direction. Many, if not most,  residents of Mordecai, Pilot Mill and Capitol Park use Poplar to get onto Wake Forest Road every day, several times a day and each time, it is a roll of the dice if a car coming down WF toward downtown will hit you.   This is my third time reporting this.  It was addressed once, and the hegde was trimmed back a little but it  quickly grows back.  Please have the entire hedge removed before someone gets very hurt.   We look forward to your prompt reply. 

Original report of the issue: There are large shrubs on the sidewalk that severely block visibility for drivers trying to turn left (North Bound) onto Wake Forest Road from Poplar Street. It is extremely dangerous; you have to pull out into Wake Forest Rd. in order to see if traffic is coming. This has been a problem for years and hope to see this fixed.

According to the below email string, the retaining wall is not acceptable to the City of Raleigh.  I understand that all folks in government have limits to their authority.

As per the email stream below my last piece of information was that the engineer the owner talked to said the as built condition does not work and the he would be taking it down and restructuring the wall and getting permits.  He has not obtained permits nor has any other work been done.

Just got phone call from owner/contractor.  Wall will have to be taken down.
They have contacted an engineer and the as built design is not acceptable to the engineer.  Told them again a permit is required before any more work proceeds.

Good Morning Folks,

I apologize for shotgun email approach, but I wanted to make sure all who should see this email receives it.

Please see below email thread and see images attached, re: excavation & retaining wall projects at 3404 Neptune Drive, Raleigh 27604.

The excavation project has turned into a nearly completed retaining wall construction project.  I checked the City of Raleigh permit lookup page and didn't see that a permit had been applied for the retaining wall project.
Please look into this matter per what was written in below thread from June 2013.

By the way, I'm not simply curious about this project because I'm a resident of the neighborhood -- I'm also President of The Fields HOA Board and am checking because of that association.

Thanks!

See attached photos. Not so recent excavation. Looks like they should build a retaining wall. Fence is 5' from edge of hole. Left my card on front door.
We will monitor.
If they build a retaining wall it will need design and permit/inspection.
Small area disturbed. Not enough for grading/LD permit.
Met tenant on my way out. Apparently water from hill was migrating into crawlspace. Asked tenant to have owner to call me.

813,1237807,Oil Spewing Garbage Truck,"This past Tuesday, Aug 12th, the garbage truck that services my neighborhood left thick trails of oil on our streets. This wasn't a simple drip here and there, this was a steady stream of fluid. Surely the truck lost a substantial amount if oil; whether it be motor oil or hydraulic fluid. You can follow these oil trails throughout the Sawmill Rd area, tracing the truck's route. The stains are the heaviest in my immediate area [Hemlock Ct].

This is not only an eye sore, but also an environmental concern. There was rain Tuesday evening which in turn washed the standing oil into the surrounding drains. 

Myself and my neighbors hope that the department for truck maintenance is alerted of the leaking truck and it is repaired immediately. No doubt this truck is driving on other routes in Raleigh. Moreover, we would like our street treated in an environmentally safe way so that the oil is pulled up from the asphalt.

School began today and I again observed buses not being able to pull up in front of the school due to cars parked in the way.  I'm including 2 pictures.  One shows 1 bus in front of the school and a line of parked cars, which prevented the second bus from pulling up in front of the school.  The second picture shows the second bus.  It is to the east of Swain St., one block away from the school.  This can't be ideal for student safety.  Additionally, there is a city bus stop on this block (E. Hargett between Swain and Monie).  The parked cars prevent the city bus from pulling up to the bus stop.  Finally, my neighbors and I have difficulty pulling out of our neighborhood (Monie Ln.), because we cannot see around the parked cars.  Today this block of Hargett St was only about half full of parked cars.  Many days the entire block is full of parked cars.  On those days, the buses can't get near the school.

1126,1014252,Parks / Greenways,"Last July the multi-purpose field at Williams Park was closed for renovation of the field to include the planting of Bermuda grass.  The field was to re-open in March of this year.  I was told last week that the Bermuda did not take and the field would remain closed most of this year as well.  I looked at the field this morning and the grass is very green which I find odd because Bermuda grass is still dormant.  There are a few areas that need additional attention, but overall I think the field is in good shape. 
A couple of years ago that field was closed using the excuse that there was a water drainage issue from the tennis courts.  Clearly there was no issue and the field was re-opened after I inquired to the Parks and Recreation Department.  Now we have this issue again with this field being closed and another phony excuse.  I use the word phony because clearly Bermuda grass was not planted.
Both of the closings of this field occurred immediately after groups of Hispanic people began playing soccer on the field.  About five to six years ago, the same thing happened at the Kiwanis Park.  The field was closed and a very large fence was erected and then locked.    The Hispanics that were playing at these fields were enjoying the weekend afternoons and from what I saw they were having a good time with their families and friends.  It is obvious to me these actions were the result of someone in the neighborhood complaining about the people using the field.  
The field at Williams Park belongs to the people of Raleigh and by keeping it closed your department is preventing all the citizens of Raleigh from enjoying the field.  The field needs to be re-opened immediately.

1157,995158,   BOARD UP THIS HOUSE NOW!,"  months have passed since a few neighbors reported the house  at 202 North State st. having lefft all of the trash and furniture in a moungtain on the yard near the street , it was there for a month and  another neighbor picked it p largely and hauled it away because he didn't want  the inspectors coming around.  This house has been the open flop for many people and the police are there almost every morning before dawn and many more times at night.   The Back windows and door are open  and are broken to  maintain access, the electricity had been hi jacked until last week when the power company took  the meter off again..  The squatters are not just homeless poor souls but some of the felons that have claimed this neighborhood  and are doing their selling  consistently here .  The police  can do nothing  to shut the house down and the inspectors case being removed is insane.  There has not been one day that that house has been secured ,  it was just sold in a ""short sale"" and  so that means  the owner hasn't closed but the bank or WHOEVER owns it needs to BOARD IT UP! This is sickening  that no one  can  keep the neighborhood from going to pot , There should be some mechanism for  stopping the people who put the city in decline  while not penalizing the people who are working hard to make  this place better.  Seriously  frustrated and disappointed in Raleigh   offices and personel who get paid  and make it hard on residents to appreciate the services. Once again , my question is what is it going to take for this neighborhood so close to the downtown to be cared for and managed better?  This area has a ridiculous amount of crime happening every day, I shouldn't have to remind anyone while a trial for a home invasion  is going on. We don't need more guns, we need more responsible care.  People need shelter  yes,but squatting  in a house illegally is not OK .

It's now Feb 6th, and we've seen no progress or updates from the city on the project.  

Can someone please let us know an accurate time table for when we'll have pavement again?  We're approaching 8 months on this project and the city has done very little to help move progress forward for us.

Living on a muddy pothole and gravel ridden street  is not only inconvenient and embarrassing but also damaging to all our vehicles, and messy in each of our yards.  I'm sure everyone would be very excited to hear from the city when the paving would likely begin and finish.

Not all temporary employees get an ID from the University and they were not being allowed to ride-  I looked on the City of Raleigh site, and there is no mention about showing an NC State University ID with your GOPASS.  I don't mind doing it, but there needs to be better communication.  There has been NONE from the University and the CoR site doesnt state that NC State employees must show their University ID when they swipe their GoPass.

If the cyprees trees(planted by the property owner) had not been there the vehicle would have crashed into a house and caused serious damage to both house and vehicle not to mention possible loss of life. Wild Dunes Drive is used by drivers as a shortcut to using Southall to Eagle Trace. There have been several incidents at this intersection since 'traffic calming' was instituted on Eagle Trace. The only way to slow traffic on Wild Dunes Drive is to place speed bumps at strategic locations, which will prevent speeding and reckless driving.

In addition to the potholes and general rough texture there are multiple manhole-type covers and other fixtures that have raised asphalt surrounding them that are not painted or marked and are very hard to see at night.  This seems dangerous for a motorcyle, moped, or cars with lower profile tires.  It is furstrating that, again, there seems to be poor coordination between the time the road was prepped for resurfacing and the actual resurfacing.  There just doesnt seem to be anyting being done to improve the road condition on a day to day basis.  The entire project on this road has been mishandled and the residents in the neighborhood along this road, who pay substantial property taxes, have been poorly served during the duration of this debacle.

Please note condition of house – to include vines growing up the front of the house along a window frame, facia board coverings peeled back exposing wood to the elements, and a hanging shutter.

Our HOA professional management company, HRW, Inc. has sent letters to BB&T about home maintenance.  This house is going downhill fast and needs to be addressed by the owners.  

This home is currently owned by BB&T.  The address on file for BB&T is 301 College St., Greenville, SC 29601-2014.  HRW has received no response from them to date regarding requests for corrective action.

As HOA Board President, I try and work toward maintaining and enhancing the value of homes in our development -- both for homeowners and for the community at large.  A rundown home such as this erodes homeowners' home values and contributes to eventual decline in the entire development.

Please weigh in on this matter with the enforcement capacity of the City of Raleigh to get this home cleaned up.

1708,1174640,Median Sign,"I am writing to express my concern about a current sign placement.  A new median was recently added at the crossroads of Kodiak Dr. and Marvino Ln. to enable drivers traveling south on Glenwood to turn left onto into the new apartment complex that was just built.  There is a yellow sign with 2 arrows showing drivers where the median is, however the placement of this sign, for the traffic traveling north on Glenwood turning left onto Kodiac Dr. is not ideal.  As you can see from the attached picture it blocks the view of the cars coming down the hill and it makes it hard to turn safely with heavy traffic after work. 

I would appreciate someone looking into this.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Last week I notice water streaming out from under the capped asphalt. I called the City public utility dept after hours to report this to which they said they would send someone out. Thats been 6 days and water is still flowing out of this repair, enough water the whole northbound lane is wet and water runs into the gutter and into the sewer system.
This is the third time I am reporting this albeit to a different department.
So being that this is the third time, what happens when my water bill comes? Obviously no one cares enough about a broke water main to fix it.

The general upkeep of the house has degraded over time (e.g. entire house in need of power washing, front porch railings, supports, and steps in need of power washing & treatment).  Please see recent picture attached.  Note the discarded mattress and the debris-filled trailer that have been there for weeks now. The owners have been mailed both a first and second violation letter from the HOA to power wash home, railings, supports, etc.  A hearing letter has been mailed regarding the inappropriately stored items in the yard.  While the The Fields HOA Board and HRW, our professional management company, are working to schedule a hearing for our next board meeting, we would appreciate the assistance of the City of Raleigh by investigating this property.  Our understanding is that the property is rented and occupied by tenants.  This home has been an ongoing problem for many years.  The owners and/or residents have received numerous violation letters for non-compliance such as parking on the lawn, maintenance of the home, mowing, junk in yard and/or around the house, unregistered and/or inoperable vehicles parked on the street and more.

But more importantly: When the condo construction is completed, will the driveway for the new residences empty onto Ashland Street in the exact location where we already have the serious issues with visibility, driver speed, etc. that have previously been discussed here? If so, and no new signs, flashing lights etc. are added, the intersection will become even more dangerous. 

Can someone in the appropriate city department please check the construction plan (and more specifically the entrance/exit/parking plan) for the new residences, and see if we are indeed going to be dumping more traffic onto this already-hazardous section of road? And if so, can someone please develop a plan to help reduce the likelihood of an accident? Thanks in advance for checking into this.

The result is that it usually takes multiple light cycles to get through the intersection, and traffic is often backed up several blocks.

these folks are NOT friendly to talk to, or to even ask a question. The ladies that work in the office are even more disrepectful, rude and mean to people. somehow I guess they feel they are entitled to be jerks. 
(there is one guy, black heavy set, and has dreadlocks..who has expressed overagressive behavior to people when asked a question..I witnessed it on west st last friday. hes been seen driving a white chevy pickup or a white dodge 4dr. )

this kind of behavior, from so called ""city employees"" give Raleigh iteslf a bad name, and keeps folks from visiting the downtown area. Im sure this is NOT what the city wants as downtown ambassadors.

these are the same concerns we as citizens have had when the parking enforcement dept was under private contract. but by just simply transfering the dept back to the city, did no good. the city needed to replace the staff at park link then, as that was the problem then, and continues to be today.

there should be NO excuse for these employees to act like they do. I understand they deal with frustrated people, and folks yelling at them, but when someone just says ""hey, can you point me to (direction)"" their response shouldnt be like we are bothering them. this is unprofessional, and disrespectful, especially to tax payers who pay their hourly wages.

3218,953894,Parks / Greenways,"I was biking on the greenway with a group yesterday coming inbound to downtown Raleigh from the Neuse River Trail on the Walnut Creek Greenway.  The tunnels on that section are all poorly lit. There are at least 10 sections of the Walnut Creek Greenway between the new connector and State Street that are becoming increasingly filled with slippery mud from the rain storms.  All of these sections were challenging to navigate by bike and you would not be able to go through this area with a family or children due to all of the maintenance issues.  On foot someone would have been forced to walk through large sections of mud.  The underpass/tunnel at State Street is impassible by bicycle or on foot due to all of the mud and slippery growth.  One of our cyclists wiped in the tunnel. I know it says to dismount, but when the choice is wading through an indeterminate amount of mud or attempting the crossing on the bicycle, most people will choose to ride and stay above the muck.

3276,948986,Signals / Signs,"As you approach the Gorman/Faircloth and Hillsborough St. intersection from Gorman street, the left turn traffic signal has a very long wait time. Specific example: this morning, I approached it as the only vehicle in that lane and sat through 4 (4!) light changes before it let me turn. And I don't mean 2 in either direction- I mean traffic crossing the intersection going both ways got 3 green lights EACH before I was able to turn left on the 4th green light for Gorman.

That being said, I do give the light credit in that the light changes are pretty quick. The issue seems to arise in that if only one vehicle approaches the left turn, it is not enough to trigger the left turn signal- even if you approach it in a wide variety of fashions (slow, fast, pull up to the white, don't pull up all the way, etc), and I drive a pickup truck so it's a heavy vehicle (that counts, right? :) ) Only when another car approaches behind the first will the light finally trigger, but that can take a while at 6:50am.

I understand that it's not a particularly pressing concern but the alternatives are to put your car in reverse and then pull forward again, or to cut through behind the applebee's parking lot and skip the light entirely, or just RUN IT (yikes!) as I have seen cars do in the morning... all of which seem to be unsafe/not particularly legal. I pass through this light 5 days a week at ~6:55 or ~7:25 and I have tried everything to trigger that light and it is pretty futile unless there are multiple cars trying to turn too. If that's just the way it is, I understand.
